1. Get rid of the open work area
2. Get rid of the war room(s)
3. Allow 100% remote for performers
4. Adopt a process and stick to it
5. Don't change priorities daily (act strategically, not tactically) 
6. Come up with a unified vision of goals and share it with the team 
7. Get behind one leader who can articulate #6 
8. Get more parking 
9. Get better at onboarding 
10. Relax security restrictions, especially for things that are not public facing, or you want the public to see.
